## üìã Common Use Cases

### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository-url]
cd PRS/app
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local
bun dev
```

Detailed instructions: [Development Guide - Getting Started](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#getting-started)

### Understanding User Permissions
```typescript
// Check user permissions
<PermissionGate permission="manage:users">
  <UserManagement />
</PermissionGate>
```

Complete permission system: [User Roles Guide - Permission Matrix](./USER_ROLES_GUIDE.md#permission-matrix)

### Using Core Components
```typescript
// UnifiedTable example
<UnifiedTable
  data={deals}
  columns={dealColumns}
  searchable
  filterable
  exportable
/>
```

Component examples: [Component Library - Core Components](./COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md#core-components)

### API Integration
```typescript
// React Query hook
const { data: deals, isLoading } = useDeals({
  status: 'pending',
  page: 1
})
```

API patterns: [API Integration - Data Fetching](./API_INTEGRATION.md#data-fetching-with-react-query)
